## 🎮 How to Use

### Spawning Drones
- **+ Hostile** - Single hostile drone
- **+ Ally** - Friendly drone (won't be jammed)
- **🐝 SWARM x5** - 5 hostile drones in formation

### Combat Operations
1. Spawn drones using spawn buttons
2. Select formation (SCATTER, LINE, WEDGE, DIAMOND)
3. Adjust environment (weather/terrain affects effectiveness)
4. Click **GLOBAL JAM** to jam all hostiles
5. Click **SELECTIVE JAM** for precision strikes
6. View **INFRASTRUCTURE SCANNER** for critical vulnerabilities

### Analysis
- Monitor **THREAT MATRIX** for real-time threat assessment
- Check **RF SIGNATURES** to see active frequency bands
- Use **PREDICT AI** to anticipate swarm movement
- Review **PRECISION** metrics for engagement success
- Scan **TRIANGULATION** for drone origin coordinates
